## **LSF-Animation**
Official PyTorch implementation for the paper:

> **LSF-Animation: Label-Free Speech-Driven Facial Animation via Implicit Feature Representation. (Accepted at [ACM SIGGRAPH Asia 2025](https://asia.siggraph.org/2025))**



> We propose LSF-Animation, a novel framework that eliminates the reliance on explicit emotion and identity feature representations. Specifically, LSF-Animation implicitly extracts emotion information from speech and captures the identity features from a neutral facial mesh, enabling improved generalization to unseen speakers and emotional states without requiring manual labels. Furthermore, we introduce a Hierarchical Interaction Fusion Block (HIFB), which employs a fusion token to integrate dual transformer features and more effectively integrate emotional, motion-related and identity-related cues.

> **Note**: This project is built upon the [ProbTalk3D](https://github.com/uuembodiedsocialai/probtalk3d) framework, extending it with emotion2vec integration and improved feature representation capabilities.

### Key Features
- **Label-Free Approach**: No manual emotion or identity labels required during training
- **Universal Speech Emotion Representation**: Integration with [emotion2vec](https://huggingface.co/emotion2vec/emotion2vec_base) for robust emotion feature extraction
- **Improved Generalization**: Better performance on unseen speakers and emotional states
- **Hierarchical Feature Fusion**: Advanced HIFB architecture for effective multi-modal integration



## **Framework Overview**

The overview of our LSF-Animation framework:

![LSF-Animation Pipeline](static/images/pipline.png)

Our framework consists of three main components:
1. **Audio Feature Extraction**: Extracts both acoustic and emotional features from speech using HuBERT and emotion2vec
2. **Identity Feature Extraction**: Captures identity information from neutral facial mesh parameters
3. **Hierarchical Interaction Fusion Block (HIFB)**: Integrates multi-modal features through fusion tokens and cross-attention mechanisms

### Hierarchical Interaction Fusion Block (HIFB)

One of the core innovation of our framework is the HIFB architecture, which effectively integrates multi-modal features:

![HIFB Architecture](static/images/HIFB.png)

The HIFB employs fusion tokens to query and integrate features from both audio and emotion streams through cross-attention mechanisms, enabling more effective multi-modal feature fusion for improved facial animation generation.

## **Model Training**
<details><summary>Click to expand</summary>
To train the model from scratch, follow the 2-stage training approach outlined below.

### Stage 1
For the first stage of training, use the following commands:
- On Windows and Linux:
    ```
    python train_all.py experiment=vqvae_prior state=new data=mead_prior model=model_vqvae_prior
    ```
- If the Linux system has Slurm Workload Manager, use the following command: 
    ```
    sbatch train_vqvae_prior.sh
    ```

- <b> Optional Operation </b>
    <details><summary>Click to expand</summary>

    - We use Hydra configuration, which allows us to easily override settings at runtime. For example, to change the GPU ID to 1 on a multi-GPU system, set `trainer.devices=[1]`. To load a small amount of data for debugging, set `data.debug=true`.
    - To resume training from a checkpoint, set the `state` to resume and specify the `folder` and `version`. Specifically, replace the `folder` and `version` in the command below with the folder name where the checkpoint is saved. Our program generates a random name for each run, and the version is assigned automatically by the program, which may vary depending on the operating system.
        ```
        python train_all.py experiment=vqvae_prior state=resume data=mead_prior model=model_vqvae_prior folder=outputs/MEAD/vqvae_prior/XXX version=0
        ```
- <b> VAE variant </b>
    <details><summary>Click to expand</summary>  
  
    To train the VAE variant for comparison, follow the same instructions as above and change the `model` setting as below:
    ```
    python train_all.py experiment=vae_prior state=new data=mead_prior model=model_vae_prior
    ```
    </details>

### Stage 2
After completing stage 1 training, execute the following command to proceed with stage 2 training. Set `model.folder` and `model.version` to the location where the motion prior checkpoint is stored:
- On Windows and Linux:
    ```
    python train_all.py experiment=vqvae_pred state=new data=mead_pred model=model_vqvae_pred model.folder_prior=outputs/MEAD/vqvae_prior/XXX model.version_prior=0
    ```
- If the Linux system has Slurm Workload Manager, use the following command. Remember to revise the `model.folder_prior` and `model.version_prior` in the file. 
    ```
    sbatch train_vqvae_pred.sh
    ```
- <b> Optional Operation </b>
    <details><summary>Click to expand</summary>
  
    - Similar to the first stage of training, the GPU ID can be changed by setting `trainer.devices=[1]`, and debug mode can be enabled by setting `data.debug=true`.
    - To resume training from a checkpoint, set the state to `resume` and specify the `folder` and `version`: 
        ```
        python train_all.py experiment=vqvae_pred state=resume data=mead_pred model=model_vqvae_pred folder=outputs/MEAD/vqvae_pred/XXX version=0 model.folder_prior=outputs/MEAD/vqvae_prior/XXX model.version_prior=0
        ```
    </details>
- <b> VAE variant </b>
    <details><summary>Click to expand</summary>
